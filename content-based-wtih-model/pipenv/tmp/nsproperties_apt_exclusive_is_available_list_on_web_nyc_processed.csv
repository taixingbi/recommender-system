Built in 1929 as an NYC design school and known for its striking terraced façade, the 27-story tower was briefly home to a print factory. In 1979, its careful conversion to 338 luxury apartments was noted with the First Honor Award from the American Institute of Architects. The apartments here feature 12- to 14-foot ceilings, with some offering wide-open views of the Midtown skyline and the East River.</p>

The 25 foot wide cast-iron elevator building sits seconds from both Chambers Street 1,2,3, A &amp; C train stations, in the C6-2A district, which is a commercial district outside the Central Business District. The building was built and designed by world renowned, James Bogardus in 1857 for the glassware manufacturing business of Francis &amp; John Hopkins.</p>
<p>The main-ground level space, formerly occupied by Trinity Grace Church, invites you into a historic 19th century time capsule, greeted by double arch French doors and exposed brick in the lobby.

<p>The second level has 200 amps of electrical service and enjoys elevator access, 12 foot high ceilings, wide planked wood floors, exposed brick and renovated bathrooms. The signature of historic TriBeCa is illustrated by the openness of the space with southern exposure on from the original landmarked cast iron façade windows.</p>

<p>A palatial floor-through condo graced with a comprehensive collection of details and finishes, this 4-bedroom, 3.5-bathroom loft is a paragon of design. Features of this 4,017 sq. ft. home include gorgeous wide plank hardwood floors, huge casement windows with northern, southern, and eastern exposure, airy 11-ft ceilings, beautiful gallery-like walls, cast-iron columns, keyed elevator access, an integrated Sonos sound system, Lutron lighting, a convenient laundry and mud room, and a unique look-through gas fireplace. </p>
<p>The home opens directly into an expansive, 38-ft wide great room saturated with southern light. The room is anchored by an open fireplace that subtly partitions the space without closing it off, and it is served by a discreetly placed yet fully outfitted wet bar. Next to the great room sits an open-concept dining room and kitchen. Conceived by Henrybuilt, the kitchen is equipped with a massive eat-in island, custom walnut cabinetry, Carrara Gold marble countertops and backsplash, and a suite of fully-integrated stainless steel appliances from Miele. Behind the kitchen lies an additional living/media room, from which the three main bedrooms are accessed.</p>
<p>The spacious master suite boasts a cavernous walk-in closet, a supplementary reach-in closet, and a windowed en-suite bathroom with radiant heated floors, limestone tiles, his-and-hers sinks, a walk-in shower, and a free-standing soaking tub. Bedrooms two and three each have private closets—one has a walk-in—as well as sublime, windowed en-suite bathrooms. The fourth bedroom, which can also be used as an office, has a north-facing window and easy access to an immaculate powder room. </p>
<p>Taking its name from those ring shaped mints that used to be made in the building, Lifesaver Lofts is a prewar condominium nestled in the high-end neighborhood of Chelsea. The building, which is served by a part-time doorman, is across the street from the Hudson River Greenway and is less than a block away from the High Line. It sits amidst a cluster of trendy galleries, restaurants, cafes, shops and bars, and is just a short walk from Chelsea Market and the Meatpacking District. Bicycle and private storage available.

What makes these homes special, what makes them unique, is the coming together of an extraordinary blend of carefully selected elements, creating a masterpiece of luxury attuned to those with a particularly discerning eye.<br />

Through the foyer, the home unfurls into an entertainer’s paradise, an enormous, open-concept living room, dining room, and kitchen which can be closed off by a custom etched telescopic glass wall.

<br />
The kitchen, a triumph of modern craft and design, is equipped with bespoke warm-toned oak cabinetry, Calacatta gold marble slab countertops and backsplash, a huge central island, and a suite of high-end Gaggenau appliances. Just off the kitchen is a unique dine-in solarium with stone flooring and direct access to the balcony. Both possess north and west-facing exposures.<br />
<br />
Completing the home are a trio of warmly-appointed bedrooms. The master suite—conveniently tucked away from the other two bedrooms—is a sanctuary all its own. It is graced with southern and eastern exposure, a massive walk-in closet, and a spa-like, en-suite bathroom with Calacatta crema marble walls, Fior Di Bosco marble floors, bespoke dual-vanity sinks, pendant lighting, a glass-enclosed walk-in steam shower, and a separate marble encased soaking tub. The second and third bedrooms lie on the opposite side of the home and both feature eastern exposure, roomy closets, and pristine en-suite bathrooms beautiful marble flooring.<br />

This spacious LOFT has 11 foot ceilings and an expansive layout.&nbsp; These
features enable a flexible comfortable utilization of space; thus allowing a
separation of the living area from the bedroom.&nbsp; The kitchen is adorned
with <b>Electrolux</b> stainless steel appliances.&nbsp; The deep gray <b>Caesar
Stone</b> counter tops compliment the white lacquer cabinets that feature
state-of-the-art soft closed drawers.&nbsp; The bathroom is finished with <b>Calcutta
Marble</b> tiled floors, counter tops, and back splash, offering a chic, clean
back drop.&nbsp; There is ample closet space half outfitted with rods and
shelving so organization is never an issue.&nbsp; Lastly, but most important, the beautiful <b>South-facing terrace</b> allows for a breath of fresh air and days of basking in the sun.&nbsp; <br></span></p>

Lower Manhattan …what a place to live!! Chic shopping, cultural attractions,
dining &amp; nightlife, convenient transportation and plenty to do outdoors.
Very much a residential neighborhood, the Financial District has some of the
City’s best schools and playgrounds. Walk the streets around 99 John and you’ll
find financiers walking along-side families. And there’s shopping too- from
Hermes and Tiffany to the shops at South Street Seaport. Plus, with 5 subway
lines, 2 water taxi docks and quick access to tunnel and bridges, the

<p>Nestled in serene Hudson Heights, the Townhomes on Cabrini offer a one of a kind, enviable opportunity to live in a collection of three stunning brand new, 22 foot wide, townhomes situated in picturesque Northern Manhattan. Modeled in traditional style with the allure of a reminiscent era of New York, which has long been forgotten, and infused with the finest of sleek modern day amenities, the Townhomes on Cabrini offer a quite respite from the hustle and bustle of New York, set against the green scape and Hudson River backdrop that only Hudson Heights can offer.  Each townhouse harmoniously blends the stone façade, with large casement windows, nine to ten foot ceilings with a well thought out gracious floorplan and high end finishes and fixtures as well as subtle design details that provide for a truly comfortable and enjoyable lifestyle.</p>
<p>The 17th Century inspired stone façade combined with the striking contrast of the dark solid mahogany doors greets visitors to a charm of historic grandeur as they enter the luxuriousness of the well-appointed interior. The entry foyer, featuring a beautiful limestone floor, leads to a spacious first floor containing a generous rec room.A marvelous open floor plan layout consisting of the living room, dining room and kitchen awaits on the second floor. Integrating an elegant mix of dark and light materials, the kitchen utilizes use of light cabinetry, double honed white marble countertops, and a dark island. In addition, top of the line stainless steel appliances are among the high quality features that will aid in the comfort of cooking. Custom millwork and wide plank dark hardwood floors are found throughout along with a dark wood paneled ceiling in the living room which provides for an allure perfect for entertaining guests. The dining room leads out to a graciously manicured lush backyard via use of double wide doors. Three large bedrooms and two bathrooms along with a laundry room are allocated to the third floor adding to the functionality of the layout. The capacious master suite and a junior master bedroom are both situated on the fourth floor. White washed, wide plank hardwood floors are found throughout all of the bedrooms. The master suite features a splendid master bathroom with dual vanities and a standalone deep soaking tub, a large walk-in closet and a private balcony overlooking the backyard. Modern day amenities found throughout the home are radiant heating, smart home automation, recessed energy efficient LED lighting, and an in-home elevator. The east facing back façade utilizes floor to ceiling glass panels which allow for sunlight to fill and warm the home throughout the day. The landscaped roof deck, accessible via the elevator, offers spectacular views of the Hudson River as well as the skyscrapers situated to the south, and contains a lounge area with a fire pit ideal for spending time with family and friends.</p>
<p>The surrounding neighborhood of Hudson Heights offers a resplendent feel, the likes of which are not seen anywhere else in Manhattan. Located between West 181st St and Fort Tryon Park, it provides ease of access to downtown via the express A train within 25 minutes. Situated along the Hudson River, west of Broadway, stunning vistas of the river, George Washington Bridge and the Jersey palisades are enjoyed from certain vantage points, specifically Bennett Park, which at 265 feet above sea level is the highest natural peak in all of Manhattan. The neighborhood is mostly comprised of pre-war buildings built in Art Deco and Tudor Revival styles mirroring the Upper West Side. Neighboring Fort Tryon Park provides the opportunity to relax outdoors as it contains 67 acres, full of winding paths, perfect for enjoying strolls and breathtaking views. The Cloisters in Fort Tryon Park is a museum well known for housing and displaying art from the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Recently, the neighborhood has enjoyed a renaissance as new businesses such as 181 Cabrini, a popular café and wine bar, along with Bangkok Heights which offers a wide array of Thai food, and Saggio, a Sicilian restaurant and beer garden have taken residency along West 181st Street. Hudson Heights also allows quick commute via automobile as it is situated along a major thorough fare route connecting the George Washington Bridge with several major highways including the Henry Hudson Parkway, Harlem River Drive, Major Deegan Expressway, as well as I-95, along with Route 4 and the Palisades Interstate Parkway in New Jersey. As such, Hudson Heights offers a fantastic alternative to lower Manhattan.</p>

Modeled in traditional style with the allure of a reminiscent era of New York, which has long been forgotten, and infused with the finest of sleek modern day amenities, the Townhomes on Cabrini offer a quite respite from the hustle and bustle of New York, set against the green scape and Hudson River backdrop that only Hudson Heights can offer.  Each townhouse harmoniously blends the stone façade, with large casement windows, nine to ten foot ceilings with a well thought out gracious floorplan and high end finishes and fixtures as well as subtle design details that provide for a truly comfortable and enjoyable lifestyle.</p>
<p>The 17th Century inspired stone façade combined with the striking contrast of the dark solid mahogany doors greets visitors to a charm of historic grandeur as they enter the luxuriousness of the well-appointed interior. The entry foyer, featuring a beautiful limestone floor, leads to a spacious first floor containing a generous rec room.A marvelous open floor plan layout consisting of the living room, dining room and kitchen awaits on the second floor. Integrating an elegant mix of dark and light materials, the kitchen utilizes use of light cabinetry, double honed white marble countertops, and a dark island. In addition, top of the line stainless steel appliances are among the high quality features that will aid in the comfort of cooking. Custom millwork and wide plank dark hardwood floors are found throughout along with a dark wood paneled ceiling in the living room which provides for an allure perfect for entertaining guests. The dining room leads out to a graciously manicured lush backyard via use of double wide doors. Three large bedrooms and two bathrooms along with a laundry room are allocated to the third floor adding to the functionality of the layout. The capacious master suite and a junior master bedroom are both situated on the fourth floor. White washed, wide plank hardwood floors are found throughout all of the bedrooms. The master suite features a splendid master bathroom with dual vanities and a standalone deep soaking tub, a large walk-in closet and a private balcony overlooking the backyard. Modern day amenities found throughout the home are radiant heating, smart home automation, recessed energy efficient LED lighting, and an in-home elevator. The east facing back façade utilizes floor to ceiling glass panels which allow for sunlight to fill and warm the home throughout the day. The landscaped roof deck, accessible via the elevator, offers spectacular views of the Hudson River as well as the skyscrapers situated to the south, and contains a lounge area with a fire pit ideal for spending time with family and friends.</p>
<p>The surrounding neighborhood of Hudson Heights offers a resplendent feel, the likes of which are not seen anywhere else in Manhattan. Located between West 181st St and Fort Tryon Park, it provides ease of access to downtown via the express A train within 25 minutes. Situated along the Hudson River, west of Broadway, stunning vistas of the river, George Washington Bridge and the Jersey palisades are enjoyed from certain vantage points, specifically Bennett Park, which at 265 feet above sea level is the highest natural peak in all of Manhattan. The neighborhood is mostly comprised of pre-war buildings built in Art Deco and Tudor Revival styles mirroring the Upper West Side. Neighboring Fort Tryon Park provides the opportunity to relax outdoors as it contains 67 acres, full of winding paths, perfect for enjoying strolls and breathtaking views. The Cloisters in Fort Tryon Park is a museum well known for housing and displaying art from the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Recently, the neighborhood has enjoyed a renaissance as new businesses such as 181 Cabrini, a popular café and wine bar, along with Bangkok Heights which offers a wide array of Thai food, and Saggio, a Sicilian restaurant and beer garden have taken residency along West 181st Street. Hudson Heights also allows quick commute via automobile as it is situated along a major thorough fare route connecting the George Washington Bridge with several major highways including the Henry Hudson Parkway, Harlem River Drive, Major Deegan Expressway, as well as I-95, along with Route 4 and the Palisades Interstate Parkway in New Jersey. As such, Hudson Heights offers a fantastic alternative to lower Manhattan.</p>

<p>The surrounding neighborhood of Hudson Heights offers a resplendent feel, the likes of which are not seen anywhere else in Manhattan. Located between West 181st St and Fort Tryon Park, it provides ease of access to downtown via the express A train within 25 minutes. Situated along the Hudson River, west of Broadway, stunning vistas of the river, George Washington Bridge and the Jersey palisades are enjoyed from certain vantage points, specifically Bennett Park, which at 265 feet above sea level is the highest natural peak in all of Manhattan. The neighborhood is mostly comprised of pre-war buildings built in Art Deco and Tudor Revival styles mirroring the Upper West Side. Neighboring Fort Tryon Park provides the opportunity to relax outdoors as it contains 67 acres, full of winding paths, perfect for enjoying strolls and breathtaking views. The Cloisters in Fort Tryon Park is a museum well known for housing and displaying art from the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Recently, the neighborhood has enjoyed a renaissance as new businesses such as 181 Cabrini, a popular café and wine bar, along with Bangkok Heights which offers a wide array of Thai food, and Saggio, a Sicilian restaurant and beer garden have taken residency along West 181st Street. Hudson Heights also allows quick commute via automobile as it is situated along a major thorough fare route connecting the George Washington Bridge with several major highways including the Henry Hudson Parkway, Harlem River Drive, Major Deegan Expressway, as well as I-95, along with Route 4 and the Palisades Interstate Parkway in New Jersey. As such, Hudson Heights offers a fantastic alternative to lower Manhattan.</p>

<p>Welcome home to this high-floor, corner 4 Bedroom, 2.5+ Bathroom apartment at the renowned Ansonia Condominium: A one of a kind residence where form meets function. <strong>OFFERED FURNISHED OR UNFURNISHED</strong><em> (see pricing options below)</em>.</p>
<p>Spanning almost 2,800 square feet and occupying the entire northeast corner of the 12th floor, residence #12-109 showcases a harmonious balance between quintessential prewar elegance and modern family living. Upon entering, guests are greeted by oversized, original double paneled doors giving way to a formal entry foyer and gallery. Rich, paneled walls conceal a powder room for guests to your right, complete with custom glass hand tiling and stone accents. On your left, a library &amp; family room plays host to informal gatherings. Beyond the library is a separate laundry room with service entrance &amp; washer/dryer.</p>
<p>Proceed further into the gallery and take in unobstructed city views east towards the Central Park West skyline and north up Broadway as the residence opens into three massive entertaining spaces: First, a 20+ foot round formal living room with soaring ceilings, original moldings, and three oversized french windows. Adjacent, a dining area (seats up to 12) stuns with a built-in china display and another oversized, arched french window facing east. Beyond the dining area is the heart of the home and arguably one of the largest kitchens ever built in The Ansonia. Customzied from top to bottom, two-toned wood cabinetry frame the space, showcasing a 6-burner viking range with dual oven, Sub-Zero refrigerator, Bosch dishwasher, wine fridge, and seemingly endless pantry/cabinet storage. A custom three-level island serves as the centerpiece, offering a division of space between the kitchen and dining room, counter seating for five, a dual sink with garbage disposal, accented by two more french windows saturating the space with sunlight throughout the day.</p>
<p>Uncharacteristic for most new construction and renovated apartments, Residence #12-109 was reimagined for optimal family living. Off the formal gallery is an entrance to the bedroom wing. A home office sits tucked into the hallway as well as a full bath and european-style shower room (an ideal addition for larger families with busy schedules). From there, the hallway splits into two wings flanked by an abundance of closets and built-in storage. The Master Suite, which occupies roughly half of the bedroom wing, promotes tranquility and privacy, with virtually every square inch utilized to the fullest. Custom cabinetry offers plenty of 'his and hers' storage potential in addition to a separate shoe closet. The windowed Master Bathroom rounds out this stunning suite with even more storage, a pedestal sink, and walk-in dual shower with a built-in bench.</p>
<p>The other half of the bedroom wing boasts three additional bedrooms: A corner bedroom with window seat and dual closets + 2 additional bedrooms each with it's own walk-in closet. All three are awash with natural sunlight and feature large french windows with unobstructed views up Broadway.</p>
<p>In addition to the main apartment, Residence #12-109 also has a detached staff apartment that is currently being used as a home office. This option will tack on another 350 square feet to your new home and would serve as the perfect addition for hired help, guests in town, or those requiring a live/work space.</p>
<p>Last, but most certainly not least, the current owners will consider leaving select pieces of their comprehensive art collection (valued at over $250,000) on display for the incoming tenants. Works vary in both size and medium, including signed pieces by the likes of Robert Rauchenberg &amp; Sally Mann.</p>
<p>Completed in 1904, The Ansonia stands out as one of The Upper West Side's premier prewar condominium buildings. Steeped in history, having been home to many celebrated residents including Babe Ruth, Jack Dempsey, Gustav Mahler, Arturo Toscanini, Sergei Rachmaninoff, and Igor Stravinsky. The building originally housed a farm on the roof, delivering fresh eggs daily to its tenants. It was converted to a condominium in 1992. The building also housed the Continental Baths where Bette Midler and Barry Manilow performed early in their careers. It was added to the National Register of Historic places in 1980. The exquisite Beaux-Arts details make it one of the most beautiful and unique buildings in New York. </p>
<p>As far as location is concerned, The Ansonia's is second to none: Perched above Verde Square on 73rd Street and Broadway, you are mere steps from Fairway, Citarella, Zabar's, Lincoln Center, the 1/2/3/B/C lines, M72, M5 Express, Central Park, The Hudson River Promenade, some of the best public and private schools in the city, and more shopping &amp; restaurants than you can name.</p>
